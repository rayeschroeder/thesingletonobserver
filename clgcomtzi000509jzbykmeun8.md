Testability in software refers to the ease with which a software system can be tested. A highly testable software system will have the following characteristics:

1. Modular Design: The system will be divided into modules that are loosely coupled, allowing individual modules to be tested in isolation.
    
2. Well-defined Interfaces: The interfaces between different modules will be well-defined, making it easier to test each module independently.
    
3. Predictable Behavior: The system will behave predictably, with a clear set of inputs and outputs, making it easier to test and verify its behavior.
    
4. Test Automation: The system will have automated testing processes in place that can be executed quickly and repeatedly to verify its behavior.
    
5. Debugging Support: The system will have debugging tools that allow developers to quickly identify and fix problems that arise during testing.
    
6. Test Data Management: The system will have a way to manage test data, making it easy to set up test cases and verify expected behavior.
    
7. Scalability and Performance Testing: The system will have the ability to test for scalability and performance issues to ensure that it can handle expected loads.
    

Overall, a highly testable software system will be designed with testing in mind, making it easier to verify its behavior, identify and fix problems, and ensure high-quality performance over time.
